# Examples

This folder contains multiple examples of templates created with the *validit*
module. Each subfolder contains a `.py` file which stores a single variable
`__template__` that represents the template of the other files (`.json`, `.yaml`,
`.toml`) in the same subdirectory.

The examples are part of the CI tests, which insures that they are valid examples
and that the templates are correct.
